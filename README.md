Spotify_Dataset_Visualisations

The Dataset that has been chosen by me for exploratory analysis and to implement Various Visualisation
Techniques is called “SPOTIFY SONGS” which is a CSV file that contains a lot of music data along with its
corresponding audio features data that can be used to classify, explore and visualize data extensively on the
basis of exploratory data analysis and different kinds of visualization techniques.I will be making majority
of my visualizations on pop music from this dataset.Spotify is a Swedish-based audio streaming and media
services provider, which launched in October 2008. It is now one of the biggest digital music, podcast, and
video streaming service in the world that gives access to millions of songs from artists all over the world.
